{"name":"Kiries","tagline":"A turn-key deployment of Kibana, Riemann and ElasticSearch","body":"# Kiries - KIbana, RIemann and ElasticSearch\r\n\r\nWe wanted a point-and-shoot real-time trend analysis dashboard for our\r\nRiemann-based cluster monitoring, as well as for other generic\r\ntime-series data sources.  So, we glued our favorite tools together\r\nwith Clojure.\r\n\r\nWe include the following versions of the third-party components\r\n\r\n* [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) (3.0.0milestone3)\r\n* [Riemann](http://riemann.io) (0.2.2)\r\n* [Elastic Search](http://www.elasticsearch.org) (0.90.3)\r\n* [Elastic HQ](http://elastichq.org) (c321806)\r\n\r\nThose projects have all done incredible work, and Kiries is just a\r\nlittle glue and some documentation tying them together.\r\n\r\nAny clojure dependencies are described in the `project.clj`.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [User Guide](resources/htdocs/index.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Quickstart\r\n\r\n__WARNING__ : Kiries will open publicly accessible ports on your host.\r\nRead the installation instructions below, or live dangerously\r\n\r\nUnpack an archive or checkout the repo and run:\r\n\r\n    bin/kiries\r\n\r\nAnd point your browser at <http://localhost:9090/index.html>\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nUnpack the archive, or open up the git repository, and you will see a\r\ndirectory structure like this:\r\n\r\n * `config` -- configuration files for riemann and ElasticSearch\r\n * `resources/htdocs` -- Web documents, including Kibana, and it configuration in `kibana/config.js`\r\n * `src` -- Kiries src files\r\n * `logs` -- log files\r\n * `bin` -- helper shell scripts\r\n * `lib` -- libraries and jars\r\n\r\n__WARNING__ : Kiries will open several publically accesible ports on your host.\r\n\r\n * 9090 -- Webserver, serving up Kibana and docs\r\n * 9200,9300 -- ElasticSearch HTTP and Native APIs\r\n * 5555 -- Riemann listeners (tcp and udp)\r\n\r\nRead the following and take precautions as you see fit.\r\n\r\nBy default, Kiries will start up Riemann tcp and udp servers on port\r\n`5555`.  It will index all events it receives into ElasticSearch.  To\r\ncustomize this behavior, edit the `config/riemann.config` file.\r\n\r\nKiries will also start up ElasticSearch listening on the default\r\nports.  ES will store it's data in the `data` directory (relative to\r\nwhere the java runtime was started from.  To customize the ES\r\nbehavior, edit the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file.  If you customize\r\nthe http host and port, be sure to update the Riemann and Kibana\r\nconfigurations.\r\n\r\nKibana is a series of HTML and Javascript files served up from\r\n`htdocs` and it's configuration is in `htdocs/kibana/config.js`.  We\r\nserve up Kibana using an internal webserver, whose default port is\r\n`9090` and will listen on all interfaces.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n\tbin/kiries   # call with -? for cmd line args\r\n\r\nAnd point your browser at <http://localhost:9090/index.html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
