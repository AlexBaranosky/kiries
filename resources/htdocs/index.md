# Welcome to Kiries

## Getting Data Into Kiries

Kiries is a Riemann server, that will dump events it recieved into
ElasticSearch, like LogStash does.  So the easiest way to get data
into it, is to send Riemann events too it.

## Dashboard

Once you have data loaded, you can view it With [Kibana](/kibana/index.html).

## Managing ElasticSearch

We've bundled [ElasticSearch HQ](/HQ/index.html), a great ES cluster
management plugin.
